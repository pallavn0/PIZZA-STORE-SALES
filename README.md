# PIZZA-STORE-SALES
## Problem Statement
A popular pizza store chain wants to analyze its sales performance to make data-driven decisions for improving revenue, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The company has a database consisting of four key tables:

Orders – Records details about each order placed, including order ID, customer ID, order date, and status.

Order Details – Contains item-level data for each order, such as order ID, pizza ID, quantity, and special instructions.

Pizzas – Information about each pizza offered, including pizza ID, name, size, and price.

Customers – Stores customer information like customer ID, name, contact details, and location.

## The goal of the project is to perform a comprehensive sales analysis by answering questions such as:

What are the best-selling and least-selling pizzas?

What is the trend of sales over time (daily, monthly, seasonally)?

Which pizza sizes and types generate the most revenue?

Who are the most valuable customers?

How does customer location affect sales performance?

Are there patterns in ordering behavior that can be used for marketing strategies?
